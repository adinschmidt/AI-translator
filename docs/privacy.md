# Privacy & Permissions

AI Translator runs locally in your browser. It does not collect user data or
track browsing behavior. All translation requests go directly from your browser
to the provider endpoint you configure.

## Permissions

- `host_permissions` (`https://*/*`, `http://*/*`): Allow the selection button
  and page translation to run on any site you visit.
- `activeTab`: Grants temporary access when you explicitly trigger a translation.
- `storage`: Save settings like API keys and model preferences.
- `scripting`: Inject translation scripts into the page when requested.
