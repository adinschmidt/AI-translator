Then `applyTranslatedHTML()` clears **all** children of the unit element and inserts the translated fragment. This deletes DOM content that was intentionally excluded from translation (images, icons, widgets, etc.).\n\nExample (typical Wikipedia infobox cell):\n`\u003cspan typeof=\"mw:File\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"...\"\u003e\u003cimg ...\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca ...\u003e...\u003c/a\u003e...`\n\nCurrent behavior can drop the `\u003cimg\u003e` after translation.\n\n## Goal / Scope\nImplement Option 2: translate only **text-bearing regions** inside a “safe” unit element while leaving non-text / complex nodes untouched. Preserve existing sanitization (DOMPurify) and keep the allowlist unchanged (do **not** add `img`).\n\n## Non-Goals\n- Do not add `img` (or other complex tags) to the simplified HTML allowlist.\n- Do not rewrite provider/background translation logic.\n- Do not modify `dist/` or vendored `*.min.js`.\n- Do not translate extension UI/overlays/options UI.\n\n## High-Level Approach (Option 2)\n- For each selected unit element, scan its **direct** `childNodes`.\n- Identify contiguous “translatable regions”: sequences of text nodes and inline elements with meaningful text.\n- Exclude/skip/keep untouched non-text or complex nodes (e.g., image-only spans/anchors, icons).\n- Translate only the region’s simplified HTML.\n- Apply results by surgically replacing only the nodes belonging to each region (Range-based or equivalent), leaving preserved siblings (like image wrappers) in place.\n- Support multiple regions per element.\n\n## Risks / Edge Cases\n- Region boundary correctness around `\u003cbr\u003e` / `\u003cwbr\u003e` / block-ish nodes embedded inline.\n- Inline elements containing both text and images (mixed content).\n- Node targeting robustness when DOM changes between collection and apply.\n- Chunking and ordering: large regions must split/reassemble safely without corrupting DOM structure.\n- Partial failures: a failed region translation must not wipe preserved nodes.\n\n## Child Tickets Checklist\n- [ ] A. Design spec: translatable regions + targeting strategy\n- [ ] B. Implement region discovery and unit generation\n- [ ] C. Implement surgical DOM apply for a region\n- [ ] D.
